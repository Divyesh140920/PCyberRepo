# Web Application Vulnerability Scanner

## Description
A simple Python-based web vulnerability scanner that detects common issues like:

- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

The tool sends crafted HTTP GET requests with malicious payloads to a specified URL and analyzes the server's response for vulnerability signs.

## Features
- Tests for SQL Injection by sending common SQL payloads and checking for database error messages.
- Tests for reflected XSS by injecting common XSS payloads and detecting if they appear in the response.
- Easy to customize target URL, parameters, and payloads.
- Basic and lightweight scanner for quick assessments.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)

## Usage
1. Clone or download the script.
2. Modify the `target_url` and `test_param` variables in `web_vuln_scanner.py`.
