# Firewall Rule Visualizer and Generator

## Description
This Python tool parses firewall rule files (iptables-like syntax), detects conflicts, and visualizes rules graphically using a directed graph. It also suggests basic optimizations to improve rule efficiency and security.

## Features
- Parses simple firewall rule files with action, protocol, source/destination IP and ports.
- Detects conflicting rules (e.g., same parameters but different actions).
- Visualizes rules and their order using a graph.
- Suggests merging or optimization opportunities.
- Easy to extend for more complex parsing and analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `networkx` and `matplotlib` libraries (`pip install networkx matplotlib`)

## Usage
1. Create or provide a firewall rules file (`firewall_rules.txt`) in the specified format.
2. Run the script: `python firewall_rule_visualizer.py`
3. Review detected conflicts, optimization suggestions, and the graphical visualization.
