PCyberRepo

Welcome to PCyberRepo – a personal repository curated and maintained by Divyesh Sai Gutta to document, demonstrate, and practice key concepts in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and Python-based security tooling.

This repository serves as a hands-on showcase of various cybersecurity utilities and proof-of-concept tools built for educational and non-malicious use only.

About Me

I am a cybersecurity enthusiast and MS ITM (Cybersecurity) graduate passionate about offensive security, automation, and secure software development. This repository reflects my journey of exploring core security concepts through coding — with the aim of understanding how attacks work, and more importantly, how to defend against them.

Technologies and Skills Practiced

- Python scripting for security automation
- Network packet analysis
- Basic cryptographic algorithms
- System-level programming
- Ethical hacking tool design
- Secure coding and encryption techniques

Disclaimer

All tools, scripts, and projects in this repository are built strictly for educational and ethical purposes. Do not use any code here in unauthorized or illegal scenarios. Always have proper consent when testing security tools or techniques.

Structure

This repository is organized for clarity, with separate directories for each major area or concept. Dependencies are listed via requirements.txt where relevant, and individual projects contain their own README files with usage details.

Goals

- Strengthen my hands-on skills in cybersecurity domains
- Contribute open-source learning resources for beginners
- Showcase technical capabilities for prospective employers

If you find anything useful or want to collaborate, feel free to fork, star, or open issues. Feedback is always welcome.
